        over 300,000 TikTok videos as background music for the "Silhouette
        Challenge", an online challenge in which participants danced while
        illuminated from behind with red lighting. Driven primarily by streams
        and digital sales, the song peaked within the top 20 of many national
        record charts, including the US Billboard Hot 100, and received platinum
        certifications in eight countries. "Streets" was sent to US contemporary
        hit radio stations as Hot Pink's seventh and final single on February
        16, 2021. A corresponding music video premiered the next month,
        depicting Doja Cat's own version of the Silhouette Challenge.
